# Benchmarking Sagemaker Training instances for Named Entity Recognition

This is a personal project for curiosity and information. I use Google Colaboratory notebooks for practicing deep learning and nlp. I intend to use my local machine as well as automation provided by cloud platforms such as AWS. I am already familiar with batch processing but want to dive a bit deeper into training instances available in Sagemaker.

Sagemaker has multiple instances that can be used for training, and I want to figure out which instance can be the best for me in terms of cost effectiveness and performance.

The scope of this project is to compare the training times of a `Named Entity Recognition` model on various instances. The code is inspired from the [ðŸ¤— Course](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter7/2?fw=pt).
